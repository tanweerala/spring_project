Dependency injection
====================
Providing object of a class to the object of another class during construction of another class object or after construction of another class object is called dependency injection

Let us suppose object of class AA wants object of class BB.It means object of class BB is dependency of object of class AA

Giving object of class BB to the object of class AA is called dependency injection

If your application is using spring framework then this task will be performed by IOC container

We will have to configure dependency injection

Types of dependency injection
==============================
1)Setter injection
2)Constructor injection
