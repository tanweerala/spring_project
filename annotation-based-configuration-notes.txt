Types of configuration in spring
--------------------------------
Three types of configuration is possible in spring framework
1)XML based configuration
2)Annotation based configuration
3)Java code based configuration 


Annotation based configuration
------------------------------
We can configure our bean classes by using annotation too
We can use following annotation for bean

1)@Component
2)@Controller
3)@Service
4)@Repository

These annotations are stereotype annotations


@Autowired annotation
=====================
This annotation is used for dependency injection
We wiil have to use this annotation inside dependent class
It can be used following three level/position

1)Just before dependency declaration
2)Just before constructor 
3)Just before setter method

@Component
public class BB
{
}

@Componemt
public class AA
{
   //@Autowired	
   private BB obj;

   public AA(){}
   //@Autowired	
   public AA(BB obj)
   {
	this.obj=obj;
   }
   //@Autowired	
   public void setObj(BB obj)
   {
	this.obj=obj;
   }
}
